# Prompt  
Name this conversation following this pattern: `Daily Notes for yyyymmdd`.

Create a set of markdown files for all meetings on my calendar today. For each meeting:

## 1. In the **main file** (`yyyymmdd_meetings.md`), include:
- The **title**, formatted in wikilink style: `[[YYYYMMDD-<sanitized-title>]]`
- The **time** (e.g., `12:30 PM - 1:00 PM`)
- The **organizer's name**
- My **accept status**

Where `<sanitized-title>` is:
- The meeting title with **all non-filesystem-compatible characters** (e.g., `|`, `/`, `\\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `&`, `%`, `#`, etc.) replaced with **dashes**
- Delete all **whitespace characters** around dashes in the filename
- Then **truncated to 32 characters** (excluding the date prefix and `.md` extension)
## 2. Create a **separate markdown file** for each meeting titled:
```
YYYYMMDD-<sanitized-title>.md
```

Use the <sanitized-title> created for the main file in step 1.

Each individual file should contain:
- Date template strings in the markdown are replaced with the **time**
- The **organizer**
- A **comma-separated list of attendees**

## 3. Package all generated markdown files into a single tar archive for download.

- Ensure that the tar archive is compatible with Windows and Powershell for extraction using the `tar` command
- Use **Linux linefeed format** (`\n`) for all files.
- The archive filename should include today's date in the format "yyyymmdd-meetings.tar"
